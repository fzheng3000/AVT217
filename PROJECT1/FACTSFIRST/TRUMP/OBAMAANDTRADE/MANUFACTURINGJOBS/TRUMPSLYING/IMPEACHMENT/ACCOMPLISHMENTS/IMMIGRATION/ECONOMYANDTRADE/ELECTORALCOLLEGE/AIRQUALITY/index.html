       <p>"We want to have the cleanest water on Earth. We want to have the cleanest air on Earth. Our numbers, as you saw -- we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good -- our environmental numbers. Our water numbers, our -- our numbers on air are tremendous...But we are doing better right now than we've ever done, in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers." -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.
Additionally, there were more "unhealthy air days" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more "unhealthy air days" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama. <a href="../../../../../../../../../../index.html">AIRQUALITY.</a></p>
