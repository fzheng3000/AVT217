       <p> Mark Zuckerberg's White House visit "...and Mark Zuckerberg was in the White House two weeks ago and he said, 'You're number one on Facebook.'" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo
Facts First: Zuckerberg, the chairman and chief executive officer of Facebook, has not been to the White House since a dinner with Trump there in October, about three months prior to this Trump claim, Facebook spokesman Dave Arnold told CNN. Arnold declined to comment on what Zuckerberg said to Trump, and Trump wasn't clear what he meant by "number one."
Trump has a long history of moving past events closer to the present, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>


<p>The individual mandate and Obamacare"We've done well with health care anyway. We got rid of the individual mandate. And if you look at that, that was a big thing with Obamacare. That was the end of Obamacare." -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo
Facts First: The individual mandate, which required Americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of Obamacare -- but it was not "the end of Obamacare" when Republicans repealed the mandate in their 2017 tax bill. Key components of Obamacare remain.
The bill did not eliminate Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. While Trump continued to take other steps to weaken Obamacare, much of it still exists.</p>

<p>Obama, the European Union and trade Trump said he was going to start negotiating a trade deal with the president of the European Commission, then added, "They haven't wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me." He also said: "...Our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to him." -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
Facts First: It's not true that the European Union refused to talk to Obama about trade. In fact, the European Union engaged in three years of negotiations with the Obama administration on a possible US-EU free trade agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The negotiations faltered in 2016.</p>

<p>Michael Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton "But he (Bloomberg) had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become Secretary of State. It was very simple. People know that. And it wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe. I mean, so they were playing with Michael." -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen
Facts First: There is no evidence Clinton had a deal to give the Secretary of State post to either Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, or McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia.
Trump may have been basing his claim on a hacked 2015 email exchange released by WikiLeaks in 2016. Clinton adviser Neera Tanden asked Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson about a media report about some Democrats having approached Bloomberg to run against Clinton in the 2016 election.
As the New York Post reported, Wolfson responded that the idea was "laughable." Tanden soon asked what role Bloomberg might want in a Clinton administration, saying, "Is like Ambassador of China way too small." Wolfson responded, "Secty of state Which ain't gonna happen."
Tanden then forwarded the exchange to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, but the emails do not show any kind of deal. Bloomberg's campaign did not respond this week to a request for comment; Tanden told CNN this week: "There was absolutely no deal. Period. It was a random email from me to a good friend, who works for him."
Tanden said she has never even heard any discussions about McAuliffe as Secretary of State, "like ever." At CNN's request, Chris Bolling, executive director of McAuliffe political action committee Common Good VA, put Trump's claim to McAuliffe, then quickly called back laughing. He said McAuliffe had said, "I would love to be Secretary of State, but I had no deal to be Secretary of Sate."</p>

<p>The length of drug trials Praising China for cracking down on illegal fentanyl, Trump said China's "quick trials" last merely "one day." He continued: "Ours take 15 years; theirs take one day." -- January 24 speech to mayors
Facts First: Trump might have been intending this as non-literal hyperbole, but nonetheless, US drug trials do not last 15 years. Even the trial of drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman took three months.
China's legal system, of course, affords few rights to accused people, almost all of whom are swiftly convicted. In the US, some cases last longer than others, and appeals can extend the process, but veteran lawyers said Trump was way off. Kenyen Brown, a former US attorney in Alabama who now has a private litigation practice, said Trump's comment was "hyperbole to the point of being ridiculous."
"The typical possession with intent to distribute or drug conspiracy federal drug trial concludes after two to three days tops. Of course there are outliers in a few more complicated cases but the President's comment is nonsensical," he said in an email.
Trump was exaggerating even if he was describing the timeline for an entire case, not just the trial alone. "President Trump's statement is a gross exaggeration and it is not true," said David Haas, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who is now a criminal defense lawyer and has represented people accused of drug trafficking. "Most federal cases are resolved, either by plea or trial, within months of being filed. That length can vary but it would be unusual for any federal case to be pending longer than 12-18 <a href="IMMIGRATION/index.html">months."</a></p>
