       <p>Trump's lying
Trump said of his opposition to Clinton's impeachment: "But in a certain way, I was sticking up for Clinton -- for Bill Clinton...I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things -- a lot of bad things. Now, with me, there's no lying. There's no nothing." -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
Facts First: Trump's claim that "with me, there's no lying" is itself clearly false. He has been so broadly dishonest about Ukraine and impeachment that we were able to compile a list of 65 different false claims he had made on the subject.
John Bolton and the Democrats
"They didn't want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!" -- January 20 tweet
Facts First: Trump can criticize House Democrats for being in "too much of a rush" with their impeachment inquiry to subpoena Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser. But it's not true that "they didn't want" Bolton. Democrats asked Bolton on October 30 to testify voluntarily on November 7. He declined to appear -- because Trump's White House directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry.
Democrats decided against issuing a subpoena because they were concerned about the possibility of a lengthy court battle. You can read a full fact check here.
What happened after Trump released the transcript
"When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world -- and it was a totally phony story -- then I released the transcript...When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say, 'Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.'" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
Facts First: As we have repeatedly noted, Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before, not after, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff delivered an exaggerated rendition of the call at a committee meeting. When Trump released the transcript, therefore, Democrats did not say it was different than what Schiff had said.
A Fox News poll on the impeachment trial
"Majority of people say 'the U.S. Senate already has enough information!' @FoxNews" -- January 26 tweet
Facts First: The Fox News poll Trump appeared to be referencing found that 48% of people questioned said the Senate already has enough information to make its decision on Trump's articles of impeachment, versus 44% who said the Senate needs to hear more witness testimony. Forty-eight to 44 is a plurality, not a majority.<a href="ACCOMPLISHMENTS/index.html">majority.</a></p>
