       <p>The economy has added 487,000 manufacturing jobs under Trump. Manufacturing job growth slowed significantly in 2019, with a total gain of just 29,000 jobs from January through December, but the President still has a pretty good true story to tell here.
Instead, Trump often chooses to spout fiction. He said in a speech to mayors last week: "We've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs."
Trump has consistently exaggerated manufacturing job growth -- and as the actual number of jobs created has continued to grow, he has continually increased the inaccurate figure he uses. When the actual number was around 350,000, he said it was "almost 500,000." When it was just over 400,000, he said it was "600,000." <a href="TRUMPSLYING/index.html">TRUMPSLYING.</a></p>
