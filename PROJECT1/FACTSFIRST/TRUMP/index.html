       <p>Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump made 44 false claims last week, 30 of them in a press conference and two interviews during his two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Trump made 16 false claims about Ukraine, 13 about impeachment and nine about the economy.He made 12 false claims in his Davos press conference. He added 10 in his interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business and eight in his interview with Joe Kernen of CNBC.
While 44 false claims in one week would be a lot for most politicians, it is below Trump's average of about 60 false claims per week since July 8, when we started tracking this data at CNN. The week we're discussing here, from January 20 through January 26, ranks 22nd out of the 29 weeks we have tracked.
Trump is now up to 1,729 false claims since July 8.<a href="OBAMAANDTRADE/index.html">OBAMAANDTRADE.</a></p>
